Conan
=====

Decentralized, open-source (MIT), C/C++ package manager.

- Homepage: https://conan.io/

Conan is a package manager for C and C++ developers:

- It is fully decentralized. Users can host their packages on their servers, privately. Integrates with Artifactory and Bintray.
- Portable. Works across all platforms, including Linux, OSX, Windows (with native and first-class support, WSL, MinGW),
  Solaris, FreeBSD, embedded and cross-compiling, docker, WSL
- Manage binaries. It can create, upload and download binaries for any configuration and platform,
  even cross-compiling, saving lots of time in development and continuous integration. The binary compatibility can be configured
  and customized. Manage all your artifacts in the same way on all platforms.
- Integrates with any build system, including any proprietary and custom one. Provides tested support for major build systems
  (CMake, MSBuild, Makefiles, Meson, etc).
- Extensible: Its python based recipes, together with extensions points allows for great power and flexibility.
- Large and active community, especially in Github (https://github.com/conan-io/conan) and Slack (https://cpplang-inviter.cppalliance.org/ #conan channel).
  This community also creates and maintains packages in ConanCenter and Bincrafters repositories in Bintray.
- Stable. Used in production by many companies, since 1.0 there is a commitment not to break package recipes and documented behavior.

Setup
=====

You can run Conan from source in Windows, MacOS, and Linux:

- **Install pip following** `pip docs`_.

- **Clone Conan repository:**

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ git clone https://github.com/conan-io/conan.git conan-io

  NOTE: repository directory name matters, some directories are known to be problematic to run tests (e.g. `conan`). `conan-io` directory name was tested and guaranteed to be working.

- **Install in editable mode**

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd conan-io && sudo pip install -e .

  If you are in Windows, using ``sudo`` is not required.

- **You are ready, try to run Conan:**

  .. code-block::

    $ conan --help

    Consumer commands
      install    Installs the requirements specified in a recipe (conanfile.py or conanfile.txt).
      ...

    Conan commands. Type "conan <command> -h" for help

Contributing to the project
===========================

Feedback and contribution are always welcome in this project.
Please read our `contributing guide <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
Also, if you plan to contribute, please add some testing for your changes. You can read the `Conan
tests guidelines section <https://github.com/conan-io/conan/blob/develop/conans/test/README.md>`_ for
some advise on how to write tests for Conan.

Running the tests
=================

**Install python requirements**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install -r conans/requirements_server.txt
    $ python -m pip install -r conans/requirements_dev.txt

If you are not Windows and you are not using a python virtual environment, you will need to run these
commands using `sudo`.

Before you can run the tests, you need to set a few environment variables first.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)

On Windows it would be (while being in the Conan root directory):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ set PYTHONPATH=.

Conan test suite defines and configure some required tools (CMake, Ninja, etc) in the
``conftest.py`` and allows to define a custom ``conftest_user.py``.
Some specific versions, like cmake>=3.15 are necessary.


You can run the tests like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pytest .


A few minutes later it should print ``OK``:

.. code-block:: bash

    ............................................................................................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 146 tests in 50.993s

    OK

To run specific tests, you can specify the test name too, something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pytest conans/test/unittests/client/cmd/export_test.py::ExportTest::test_export_warning -s

The ``-s`` argument can be useful to see some output that otherwise is captured by pytest.

Also, you can run tests against an instance of Artifactory. Those tests should add the attribute
``artifactory_ready``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pytest . -m artifactory_ready

Some environment variables have to be defined to run them. For example, for an
Artifactory instance that is running on the localhost with default user and password configured, the
variables could take the values:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export CONAN_TEST_WITH_ARTIFACTORY=1
    $ export ARTIFACTORY_DEFAULT_URL=http://localhost:8081/artifactory
    $ export ARTIFACTORY_DEFAULT_USER=admin
    $ export ARTIFACTORY_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password

``ARTIFACTORY_DEFAULT_URL`` is the base url for the Artifactory repo, not one for a specific
repository. Running the tests with a real Artifactory instance will create repos on the fly so please
use a separate server for testing purposes.
